Prject Boost is an exciting 2D game where your mission is to safely land a rocket from one launch pad to a landing pad, dodging through all obstacles in your way. The game features multiple levels of increasing difficulty, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles.

This game is developed on GitHub, a powerful version control platform that enables developers to collaborate and contribute to the project. By downloading the game files from our GitHub repository, you can set up the game on your computer and start playing.

Installation:

To install the game, clone this repository to your local machine. Open the project in Unity and build the game to your desired platform.

How to Play:

In Boost Me, your goal is to guide the rocket from the launch pad to the landing pad without crashing into any obstacles. To control the rocket, you use the arrow keys on your keyboard. The up arrow key is used to boost the rocket's engine, while the left and right arrow keys are used to steer the rocket.

Each level of the game is filled with obstacles such as walls, asteroids, and enemy spacecraft. You need to avoid these obstacles and land the rocket on the landing pad to complete the level. Be careful not to run out of fuel or collide with any obstacles, as this will cause the rocket to crash.
